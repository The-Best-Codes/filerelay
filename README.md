## FileRelay

FileRelay is a peer-to-peer file sharing application that uses WebRTC technology to enable secure and direct file transfers between two devices. Files are never stored on a central server, ensuring privacy and security.
Since no data is stored on a central server, FileRelay is also 100% free, open-source, ad-free, and does not require any registration or login. There are (theoretically) no limits to the file size and amount of data you can share.
