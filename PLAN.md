- [x] Set up frontend to use Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI
- [ ] Set up the backend to serve the built frontend (frontend/dist) output
- [ ] Give the app a unique port number but make it easy to change via env vars (e.g., PORT=1869)

- [ ] Create the frontend flow:
  - [ ] `/`: Shows a page with "I want to..." and two buttons: "Send files", "Receive files"
  - [ ] `/instructions?go=send`: Shows a page with a WiFi icon and instructions like "Make sure both devices are connected to the same WiFi network."
  - [ ] `/instructions?go=receive`: Shows a page with a WiFi icon and instructions like "Make sure both devices are connected to the same WiFi network."
  - [ ] `/send`: Disabled UI and loading indicator while client-id is fetched from backend. Then, show a large QR code with the URL: `${VITE_BASE_URL}/receive?client-id=${clientId}` and below it the code with the text "Or enter this code manually: (code)". Show a drag and drop area with an upload button in the center for selecting files to send. Show a preview (overflow, responsive even for lots of files) of the files that will be sent. Wait until a receiver is connected and enable the send button. Allow easily adding and removing files. Think of the file list like a queue - they each get their own progress bar and percentage indicator, with an overall indicator at the top of their container, ETA times, and upload speeds. But only one is sent at a time.
  - [ ] `/receive`: Shows a page with instructions (scan the QR code on the sending device or enter the code here: [input]). Inputing redirects to `/receive?client-id=${clientId}`
  - [ ] `/receive?client-id=${clientId}`: Shows a page like "Ready to receive files!" and an area where each file received appears, with a progress bar and percentage indicator. If possible, show the ETA and upload speed for each file on the receiver too. Once a file is completely received, have the option to download it.
